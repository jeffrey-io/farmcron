# farmcron

Hi there. This is FarmCron. FarmCron is a set of web utilities that I use to help manage or plan my household. These utilities currently center around either managing my time or managing my one employee.

Much of the current utilities could be done with Excel. I suppose in life, there are two options: build or buy. I am biased towards building. In hindsight, I could have just used Excel to solve my problems, but I write code faster than can use Excel in any effective way.

Since I am writing code rather than buying some software, I have a lot more flexibility. Part FarmCron is acting as an Alexa bot or a Facebook Messenger Bot. This area is relatively unexplored, but it is a great starting ground for me.
