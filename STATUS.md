This is currently heavily coupled to my household as I am primarily working on this for fun and to get myself organized. That being said, here is where I am at.

The features are currently farm.bsg.pages where all utilities are stored. Every Java class there is a "feature" of the site. I'll run down the status of each of them now.

# Checks

This works as of now, and I use this aspect weekly. Here, I can see what I owe, then click a button, audit what I am about to pay, write the check and link the check to the database with a random hash. I don't intend to add much here beyond looks, and maybe some code clean up.

# Chores

This is the big "holy cow, this is a lot of work". The plan here is to come up with the format for all the things that I have to do around the property. Once I complete them, I reset the schedule.

# Dashboard

This is the summary of all features. It currently allows fast summary of the chores, completion of habits, and the ability to report payroll.

# Events

Ideally, this is for one-off events, chores, etc. My thinking here is that I want to be smart about things, and I'd like a wizard to assess things like "If I want to take a hike all day on a Sunday, then what are the consequnces to my chores. I have practically no work invested here which makes me sad face.

# Habits

This is the most polished feature since I use it daily.

# Payroll

This is currently working, and I use it to manage my one employee. It currently has monthly benefits accounted for, provides a portal for employee to submit hours (along with PTO and sick leave), and it will handle all witholding for taxes. It helps keeps my books orderly and it feeds into the Checks feature.

# People

This is the admin side since it supports multiple users. I am currently figuring out the Security model.

# SignIn

How people sign in

# Site

Global properties for the site in question.

# Subscriptions

This is for managing SMS text subscriptions. The feature here is so I can have people sign up to get notification when eggs are available, then I can just blast out "Hey, eggs are available". I also intend to have this be a way to manage the site via SMS.

I am working to get this working with Facebook as well.

# You

This is about you, the currently logged in person.
